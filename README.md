# Stream-Launcher

A neat little launcher that works with [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/) and the Twitch API to provide
a quick launcher to your followers.

You can download it [on my GitHub page](https://alpha-atom.github.io/streamlauncher).

Before you can use it, you need to authorise it to access your twitch account
which is also done at my [GitHub page](https://alpha-atom.github.io/streamlauncher).

Add your authorisation code to the authcode.txt file and **only** edit the line with the authcode on and
don't leave any whitespace, because right now I'm too lazy to make this code robust, so just don't
fuck it.
